# Digital-Clock
A digital clock is an electronic device . Unlike traditional analog clocks, which use hands on a dial, digital clocks show the exact time in hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds. They are commonly found on phones, computers, alarm clocks, and other electronic devices due to their easy-to-read format and accuracy.
